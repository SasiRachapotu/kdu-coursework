Homework 2 involves solving three distinct questions through a modular approach,
employing four separate modules. The first module, "Student Utility," encapsulates static functions for calculating GPAs
and filtering students within a specified GPA range.
The second module, "Semantic Analyzer,"
analyzes features by processing positive and negative opinions, yielding an opinion matrix.
The third module, "API Parser," focuses on parsing XML data to create structured book objects.
A dedicated logging module ensures systematic tracking of activities and errors throughout the entire system.
This modular design enhances code organization and facilitates task-specific functionality.
The main class likely orchestrates interactions among these modules, creating a cohesive and maintainable solution.


Homework 2 is a comprehensive project divided into four modular components,
addressing three distinct questions and implementing a logging system. The first module, named "Student Utility,"
encompasses static functions facilitating GPA calculations and the identification of students falling within specified GPA ranges.
Moving to the second module, the "Semantic Analyzer" deals with processing feature sets, positive, and negative opinions to generate a comprehensive matrix of opinions.
The third module, "API Parser," focuses on parsing XML data to construct structured book objects, aligning with the requirements of the assignment.
A dedicated logging module is implemented to systematically track activities and potential errors, contributing to overall code robustness.
The organization of the solution into separate modules not only adheres to a modular design philosophy but also enhances code readability, maintainability, and scalability.
The main class likely serves as an orchestrator, coordinating interactions between these modules.
This holistic approach showcases a thoughtful and structured solution to the multi-faceted challenges presented in Homework 2.
